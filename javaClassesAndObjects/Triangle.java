		Write a class called Triangle that can be used to represent a triangle. It should include the following methods that return boolean values indicating if the particular property holds:
		
		isRight (a right triangle)
		isScalene (no two sides are the same length)
		isIsosceles (exactly two sides are the same length)
		isEquilateral (all three sides are the same length)
		Write a simple tester program that creates a few triangles and asks them about their type.
		
		NOTE: Write appropriate TestCases.
